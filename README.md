## Repository Description

This repository contains projects related to Generative AI (GenAI) with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain. It includes implementations, experiments, and examples demonstrating how to integrate these cutting-edge technologies to build intelligent systems capable of enhanced reasoning and contextual understanding. 

The projects leverage:
- **Generative AI Models:** Creating and fine-tuning generative models.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhancing AI outputs using external knowledge sources.
- **LangChain Framework:** Seamless integration of LLMs for dynamic workflows and multi-step reasoning tasks.
