## Generative AI

**Generative AI** refers to algorithms that can generate new content, including text, images, and music. These models learn from existing data and can create new examples that mimic the style and structure of the training data.

- **Documentation:** [Generative AI Documentation](https://openai.com/research/generative-models)

### Basics
- **Types:** Text generation, image synthesis, music composition, etc.
- **Models:** GPT, DALL-E, and others.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that enhances the output of generative models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources. This approach combines the strengths of generative models with the precision of information retrieval.

- **Documentation:** [RAG Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/rag)

### Basics
- **How it works:** RAG retrieves documents from a knowledge base and uses them to inform the generation process.
- **Benefits:** Improved accuracy and relevance of generated content.

## LangChain

**LangChain** is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications that utilize large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for chaining together multiple components, allowing for complex workflows and reasoning tasks.

- **Documentation:** [LangChain Documentation](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Basics
- **Features:** Easy integration of LLMs, support for multi-step reasoning, and modular architecture.
- **Applications:** Chatbots, question-answering systems, and more.
